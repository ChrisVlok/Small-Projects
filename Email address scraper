# Firstly we need to import Regular Expressions 
# this will allow us to match certain patterns in strings and text

import re

#we are going to look at what makes an email address and express this so that we can use it as a search boundary for the computer

text = 'random string.'

#we are going to start describing the pattern that we are looking for:

pattern = re.compile('random string.')

result = pattern.search(text)  #dictates that any pattern in the search that is found inside text will be displayed as a result

print(result)

#now lets place special characters in the search pattern of the string:

pattern = re.compile('[ABCabc]')  
result1 = pattern.search(text)
print(result1)

#What we have done above is search the text list for any match of the individual letters of A B and C.
#Note that with this search method it will only display the first match it finds and none of the others

pattern = re.compile('[a-z]')  #it is case sensetive
result2 = pattern.search(text)
print(result2)

#lets look at how to find more than 1 match by adding a plus sign
  #This only works for one word at a time and not for a whole sentence

pattern = re.compile('[a-zA-Z0-9]+')  
result3 = pattern.search(text)
print(result3)

#Lets look at how we isolate an email address out of a string of multiple elements:
# A useful trick being that there is an '@' sign in an email addrerss so we can use that pattern to look for emails.

text1 = 'random string. flyguy45@gmail.co.za. viper and the boys'

pattern = re.compile('[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]+') #We use a backslash '\' to indicate that we want to search for a special character symbol, in this case the period '.' so we place it as follows: '\.'
result4 = pattern.search(text1)
print(result4)

#Now what if there are multiple email addresses in the string:
  #we manipulate the code for 'pattern.search()' and we change it to 'pattern.findall()'

text2 = 'flyguy45@gmail.co.za . mrfruit@amongus.com . welovegames@play.fr .'

pattern = re.compile('[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-zA-Z\.a-zA-Z]+')
result5 = pattern.findall(text2)
print(result5)
